This is a library providing tools for working with genome annotations.

Alpha/beta code
----------------------

The code in this library should be considered alpha/beta quality.
It likely contains errors. I'm constantly updating, improving,
fixing this code.

While I find this library extremely useful in my day-to-day work,
it has not been thoroughly tested nor used by a wide audience for
a variety of tasks. You should be skeptical about the results and
always double-check anything critical.

That said, I'd really like to reach a point where we can be reasonably
confident in this code, but it needs to be tested and used for that
to happen.
